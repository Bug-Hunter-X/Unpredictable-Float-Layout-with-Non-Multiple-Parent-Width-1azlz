The issue can be resolved by using flexbox:

```css
div {
  width: 50%;
  box-sizing: border-box; /*fixes padding issues */
}
.parent {
  display: flex;
  flex-wrap: wrap;
}
```

By using flexbox, the child elements will automatically adjust to fill the available space within the parent container, resolving the unpredictability issues caused by floating elements and differing parent widths.
