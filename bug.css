The following CSS code snippet exhibits unexpected behavior in some browsers:

```css
div {
  width: 50%;
  float: left;
}
```

The issue arises when the parent container's width is not a multiple of the child div's width (50%). In such cases, the layout can become unpredictable, with unexpected gaps or overlaps.

The floating child elements do not take into account the parent's size and may overflow or underflow their parent container.
